#summary Reference manual for the commandline-client

= Introduction =

This document tries to describe and explain all functions the commandline-client provides. Please notice that this document always refers to the latest stable versions so actual functionality might differ if you use code from svn-trunk.

One or more _options_ may be given on the commandline to customize a _command_:
    `pyrit [options] command`
The exact behaviour of _options_ depends on the _command_ and is described in the specific section further below.


=== Options ===

Pyrit recognizes the following options:

    * *-b* BSSID
    Specifies a BSSID. Can be used to restrict commands to certain Access-Points.
    * *-e* ESSID
    Specifies the ESSID. Commands usually refer to all ESSIDs in the database if this option is omitted.
    * *-i* infile
    Specifies a filename to read from; the special filename '-' can be used for _stdin_. The file may be gzip-compressed in which case it's name must end in '.gz' for transparent decompression.
    * *-o* outfile
    Specifies a filename to write to; the special filename '-' can be used for _stdout_. Filenames that end in '.gz' cause Pyrit to gzip-compress the file on the fly.
    * *-r* capture-file
    Specifies a packet-capture file in pcap format (possibly gzip-compressed) or a device (e.g. 'wlan0') to capture from.
    * *-u* URL
    Specifies the URL of the storage-device in the form of _'driver://username:password@host:port/database'_. Pyrit can use the filesystem, a remote Pyrit-Relay-Server and SQL-Databases as storage. The driver ‘_file://_' refers to Pyrit's own filesystem-based storage, _'http://'_ connects to a Pyrit-Relay-Server and all other URLs are passed directly to [http://www.sqlalchemy.org/ SQLAlchemy]. You may want to see [http://www.sqlalchemy.org/docs/05/dbengine.html#create-engine-url-arguments this documentation] for details about the syntax.
    The default storage-URL can also be specified by the key _'default_storage'_ in Pyrit's configuration file (usually _'~/.pyrit/config'_)
    * *--all-handshakes*
    The commands *attack_batch*, *attack_db*, *attack_cowpatty* and *attack_passthrough* automatically use the single handshake of highest quality only. In some cases even this handshake may have been wrongfully reconstructed from the captured data, rendering the attack futile. In case more than one EAPOL-handshake is reconstructed from the capture-file, the option *--all-handshakes* may be used to attack all handshakes reconstructable from the captured data. Exact behaviour of the commands affected by this option is described below.

=== Commands ===

    * *analyze*
    Parse one or more packet-capture files (in pcap-format, possibly gzip-compressed) and try to detect Access-Points, Stations and EAPOL-handshakes. For example:
        `pyrit -r "test*.pcap" analyze`
        
    Pyrit shows a list of Access-Points, associated Stations and EAPOL-handshakes that could be identified from the captured data. Handshakes are shown ordered by their 'quality':
    
        * _Good_
        The handshake includes the challenge from the Access-Point, the response from the Station and the confirmation from the Access-Point.
        * _Workable_
        The handshake includes the response from the Station and the confirmation from the Access-Point. The challenge was not captured.
        * _Bad_
        The handshake includes the challenge from the Access-Point and the response from the Station. The confirmation was not captured.
        
    Handshakes of the same quality are ordered by how close the packets that make up the handshake are to each other.


    * *attack_batch*
    Attack an EAPOL-handshake found in the packet-capture file(s) given by the option *-r* using the Pairwise Master Keys and passwords stored in the database. The options *-b* and *-e* can be used to specify the Access-Point to attack; it is picked automatically if both options are omitted. The password is written to the filename given by the option *-o* if specified. For example:
        `pyrit -r test.pcap -e MyNetwork -b 00:de:ad:c0:de:00 -o MyNetworkPassword.txt attack_batch`
        
    Pairwise Master Keys that previously have been computed and stored in the database are taken from there; all other passwords are translated into their respective Pairwise Master Keys and added to the database for later re-use. ESSIDs are created automatically in the database if necessary.
    
    Pyrit works down the list of reconstructed EAPOL-handshakes in case the option *--all-handshakes* is supplied.


    * *attack_cowpatty*
    Attack an EAPOL-handshake found in the packet-capture file(s) given by the option *-r* using Pairwise Master Keys from a cowpatty-like file (e.g. generated by _genpmk_/*export_cowpatty*) given by the option *-i*. The options *-b* and *-e* can be used to specify the Access-Point to attack; it is picked automatically if both options are omitted. The password is written to the filename given by the option *-o* if specified. The cowpatty-file may be gzip-compressed and must match the chosen ESSID. For example:
        `pyrit -r test.pcap -e MyOwnNetwork -i MyOwnNetwork.cow.gz -o - attack_cowpatty`

    Pyrit's own database is not touched by *attack_cowpatty*
    
    Pyrit attacks all EAPOL-handshakes at the same time if the option *--all-handshakes* is supplied. This will reduce througput (e.g. 33% throughout in case of three handshakes).


    * *attack_db*
    Attack an EAPOL-handshake found in the packet-capture file(s) given by the option *-r* using the Pairwise Master Keys stored in the database. The options *-b* and *-e* can be used to specify the Access-Point to attack; it is picked automatically if both options are omitted. The password is written to the filename given by the option *-o* if specified. For example:
        `pyrit -r test.pcap -e MyOtherNetwork attack_db`

    Only Pairwise Master Keys that have been computed previously and are stored in the database are used by *attack_db*.

    Pyrit works down the list of reconstructed EAPOL-handshakes in case the option *--all-handshakes* is supplied.
    

    * *attack_passthrough*
    Attack an EAPOL-handshake found in the packet-capture file(s) given by the option *-r* using the passwords read from the file given by the option *-i*. The options *-b* and *-e* can be used to specify the Access-Point to attack; it is picked automatically if both options are omitted. The password is written to the filename given by the option *-o* if specified. For example:
        `pyrit -r test.pcap -b 00:de:ad:be:ef:00 -i words.txt attack_passthrough`

    This command circumvents Pyrit's database and should only be used if storage-space is a problem (e.g. on LiveCDs). You should consider using *attack_batch* otherwise.

    Pyrit attacks all EAPOL-handshakes at the same time if the option *--all-handshakes* is supplied.


    * *batch*
    Start to translate all passwords in the database into their respective Pairwise Master Keys and store the results in the database. The option *-e* may be used to restrict this command to a single ESSID; if it is ommitted, all ESSIDs are processed one after the other in undefined order. For example:
        `pyrit -e NETGEAR batch`
    
    The option *-o* can be used to specify a filename the results should additionally be written to in _cowpatty_'s binary format. The option *-e* becomes mandatory and the ESSID is automatically created in the database if necessary. Pairwise Master Keys that previously have been computed and stored in the database are exported from there without further processing. Pyrit stops and exits if an _IOError_ is raised while writing to the specified file. This makes it very convenient to pipe results directly to other programs but also keep them for later use. For example:
        `pyrit -e NETGEAR -o - batch | cowpatty -d - -r wpatestcapture.cap -s NETGEAR`


    * *benchmark*
    Determine the peak-performance of the available hardware by computing dummy-results. For example:
        `pyrit benchmark`


    * *check_db*
    Unpack the entire database and check for errors like data corruption or reference errors. This function does not check the value of computed results (see *verify*). For example:
        `pyrit check_db`


    * *create_essid*
    Add new ESSIDs to the database. A single ESSID may be given by the option *-e*. Multiple ESSIDs can be created by supplying a file (one per line) via the option *-i*. Re-creating an existing ESSID does not result in an error. For example:
        `pyrit -e NETGEAR create_essid`


    * *delete_essid*
    Delete the ESSID given by *-e* from the database. This includes all results that may have been stored for that particular ESSID. For example:
        `pyrit -e NETGEAR delete_essid`


    * *eval*
    Count all available passwords, all ESSIDs and their respective results in the database. For example:
        `pyrit eval`


    * *export_passwords*
    Write all passwords that are currently stored in the database to a new file given by *-o*. Passwords are terminated by a single newline-character (`\n`). Existing files are overwritten without confirmation. For example:
        `pyrit -o myword.txt.gz export_passwords`


    * *export_cowpatty*
    Write all results currently stored in the database for the ESSID given by *-e* to the file given by *-o* in _cowpatty_'s binary format. Existing files are overwritten without confirmation. For example:
        `pyrit -o NETGEAR.cow -e NETGEAR export_cowpatty`


    * *export_hashdb*
    Write all results currently stored in the database to the airolib-ng-database given by *-o*. The database is created with a default table layout if the file does not yet exist. The option *-e* can be used to limit the export to a single ESSID. For example:
        `pyrit -o NETGEAR.db -e NETGEAR export_hashdb`


    * *import_passwords*
    Read the file given by *-i* and import one password per line to the database. The passwords may contain all characters (including NULL-bytes) apart from the terminating newline-character `\n`. Passwords that are not suitable for being used with WPA-/WPA2-PSK are ignored. Pyrit's storage-implementation guarantees that all passwords remain unique throughout the entire database. For example:
        `pyrit -i dirty_words.txt import_passwords`


    * *import_unique_passwords*
    Read the file given by *-i* and import one password per line to the database. The passwords may contain all characters (including NULL-bytes) apart from the terminating newline-character `\n`. Passwords that are not suitable for being used with WPA-/WPA2-PSK are ignored. This command does *not* check if there are duplicating passwords within the file or between the file and the database; it should be used with caution to prevent the database from getting poisoned with duplicated passwords. This command however can be much faster than *import_passwords*. For example:
        `pyrit -i dirty_words.txt import_unique_passwords`


    * *list_cores*
    Show a list of all available hardware modules Pyrit currently uses. For example:
        `pyrit list_cores`


    * *list_essids*
    Show a list of all ESSIDs currently stored in the database. This function is faster than *eval* in case you don't need to know the number of computed results. For example:
        `pyrit list_essids`


    * *passthrough*
    Read passwords from the file given by *-i* and compute their Pairwise Master Keys for the ESSID given by *-e*. The results are written to the file specified by *-o* in _cowpatty_'s binary format and are not stored in the database for later use. This command therefor circumvents the database and should only be used if storage-space is a problem (e.g. when using Pyrit on a LiveCD). The *batch*-command provides exactly the same functionality as *passthrough* but can give much better performance as results may be read from the database instead of recomputing them. 
    For example:
        `pyrit -i dirty_words.txt.gz -e NETGEAR -o - passthrough | cowpatty -d - -r wpatestcapture.cap -s NETGEAR` 


    * *relay*
    Start a server to relay another storage device via XML-RPC; other Pyrit-clients can use the server as storage-device. This allows to have network-based access to storage source that don’t provide network-access on their own (like file:// and sqlite://) or hide a SQL-database behind a firewall and let multiple clients access that database only via Pyrit’s RPC-interface. The TCP-port 17934 must be open for this function to work.
    For example, on the server (where the database is):
        `pyrit -u sqlite:////var/local/pyrit.db relay`
    ... and the client (where the big GPU is):
        `pyrit -u http://192.168.0.100:17934 batch`

    
    * *selftest*
    Run an extensive selftest for about 60 seconds. This test includes the entire scheduling-mechanism and all cores that are listed by *list_cores*. You can use this function to detect broken hardware-modules or malicious network-clients. For example:
        `pyrit selftest`


    * *serve*
    Start a server that provides access to the local computing hardware to help other Pyrit-clients. The server's IP-address should be added to the clients' configuration file (usually _'~/.pyrit/config'_) as a space-separated list under _known_clients_. These clients' _rpc_server_-setting must also be set to _'true'_. The TCP- and UDP-Port 17935 must be accessible.
    For example, on the server (where the GPU is):
        `pyrit serve`
    ... and the clients (the server's IP-address has been added to _'known_clients'_ and rpc_server is set to _'true'_):
        `pyrit -r test.pcap -b 00:de:ad:be:ef:00 -i words.txt attack_passthrough`

    
    * *strip*
    Parse one or more packet-capture files given by the option *-r*, extract only packets that are necessary for EAPOL-handshake detection and write a new dump to the filename given by the option *-o*. The options *-e* and *-b* can be used to filter certain Access-Points. For example:
        `pyrit -r "large_dumps_*.pcap" -e MyNetwork -o tiny_compressed_dump_MyNetwork.dump.gz strip`


    * *stripLive*
    Parse a packet-capture file given by the option *-r*, extract only packets that are necessary for EAPOL-handshake detection and write a new dump to the file given by the option *-o*. This command differs from *strip* as the capture-file can be any character device including sockets and other pseudo-files that _look like_ files in pcap-format. *stripLive* writes relevant packets to the new file given by *-o* as they arrive instead of trying to read the entire capture-file first.
        `pyrit -r /temp/kismet_dump -o small_dump.pcap stripLive`


    * *verify*
    Randomly pick 10% of the results stored in the database and verify their value by recomputation. You need this function if you suspect broken hardware or malicious network-clients. For example:
        `pyrit -e NETGEAR verify`


=== Exit status ===

If _command_ succeeds, Pyrit's process exit status is set to 0; otherwise it is set to 1 and (usually) an error message or a python-traceback is written to stderr. The following commands also indicate an error condition in certain cases:

    * *analyze*
    Not at least one valid EAPOL-handshake could be detected.
    * *attack_passthrough*, *attack_batch*, *attack_db* and *attack_cowpatty*
    The password could not be found.
    * *verify*
    At least one workunit contained invalid results.
    * *check_db*
    Errors in the database were found (and possibly fixed).
